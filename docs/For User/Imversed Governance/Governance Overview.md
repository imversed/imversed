# Governance Overview

> Note: Working on a governance proposal? Make sure to look at the [best practices](https://docs.imversed.com/users/governance/best_practices.html).

Imversed has an on-chain governance mechanism for passing text proposals, changing [chain parameters](https://docs.imversed.com/users/governance/param_change.html), and spending [funds from the community pool](https://docs.imversed.com/users/governance/community_pool.html).
