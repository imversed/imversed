# Imversed Clients

```List
SYNOPSIS
Learn about all the available services for clients
```

The Imversed supports different clients in order to support Cosmos and Ethereum transactions and queries:

|                            | Description | Default Port |
|----------------------------|-------------|------------|
|Cosmos gRPC                 |Query or send Imversed transactions using gRPC                                      |N/A |                
|Cosmos REST (gRPC-Gateway)  |Query or send Imversed transactions using an HTTP RESTful API                       |N/A |                
|Ethereum JSON-RPC           |Query Ethereum-formatted transactions and blocks or send Ethereum txs using JSON-RPC|N/A | 
|Ethereum Websocket          |Subscribe to Ethereum logs and events emitted in smart contracts.                   |N/A |                
|Tendermint RPC              |Subscribe to Ethereum logs and events emitted in smart contracts.                   |N/A |   
|Tendermint Websocket        |Query transactions, blocks, consensus state, broadcast transactions, etc.           |N/A |                
|Command Line Interface (CLI)|Query or send Imversed transactions using your Terminal or Console.                    |N/A |

## Cosmos gRPC

Imversed exposes gRPC endpoints for all the integrated Cosmos SDK modules. This makes it easier for wallets and block explorers to interact with the Proof-of-Stake logic and native Cosmos transactions and queries.

## Cosmos gRPC-Gateway (HTTP REST)

[gRPC-Gateway](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/) reads a gRPC service definition and generates a reverse-proxy server which translates RESTful JSON API into gRPC. With gRPC-Gateway, users can use REST to interact the Cosmos gRPC service.

See the list of supported gRPC-Gateway API endpoints for the Imversed testnet.

## Ethereum JSON-RPC

Imversed supports most of the standard JSON-RPC APIs to connect with existing Ethereum-compatible web3 tooling.

## Ethereum Websocket

Then, start a websocket subscription with [ws](https://github.com/hashrocket/ws)

# connect to tendermint websocet at port 8546 as defined above
ws ws://localhost:8546/

```List
# subscribe to new Ethereum-formatted block Headers
> {"id": 1, "method": "eth_subscribe", "params": ["newHeads", {}]}
< {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0x44e010cb2c3161e9c02207ff172166ef","id":1}
```

## Tendermint Websocket

Tendermint Core provides a Websocket connection to subscribe or unsubscribe to Tendermint ABCI events.

For more info about the how to subscribe to events, please refer to the official [Tendermint documentation](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/subscription.html).


### List of Tendermint Events

The main events you can subscribe to are:

- `NewBlock`: Contains `events` triggered during `BeginBlock` and `EndBlock`.

- `Tx`: Contains `events` triggered during `DeliverTx` (i.e. transaction processing).

- `ValidatorSetUpdates`: Contains validator set updates for the block.

:::tip
ðŸ‘‰ The list of events types and values for each Cosmos SDK module can be found in the Modules Specification section. Check the Events page to obtain the event list of each supported module on Imversed.
