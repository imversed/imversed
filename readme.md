# Imversed

Imversed is a blockchain surrounded by a ecosystem of projects which are enables the simple creation, trading, and
transfer of tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFT) without the need for coding or
engineering. Imversed is a community-driven SaaS solution that empowers businesses, influencers, and communities to use
blockchain technology. Among the most important characteristics are the following:

* Stable and secured implementation of Proof Of Stake consensus
* A graphical user interface and an API for creating user tokens
* All tokens on Imversed are interchangeable
* Non-monetary tokens are supported
* Possibility to use NFT Oracles to establish ownership and copyright.
* Integrations with major e-commerce platforms enable the sale of NFTs in the same way that traditional products are
  sold.
* Multiple token levels, and the top-level tokens can benefit from the lower-level tokens
* Infrastructure is propelled forward by a dependable engine (Imversed chain)

These extensive features are built on a dependable and secure foundation. Imversed is a blockchain application built on
top of the COSMOS library that, when combined with Tendermint Core,
provides a high-performance, consistent-in-use, and secure PBFT-like consensus engine with strict fork-accountability
guarantees over malicious actors' behavior. More information on PBFT-like consensus engines can be found
in [http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf](http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf). The BFT consensus algorithm from Tendermint Core is well-suited
for scaling public proof-of-stake blockchains.
